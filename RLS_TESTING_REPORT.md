# Game Creation Flow Testing Report

## Test Date: 2025-09-01

## Summary
The game creation flow UI works perfectly, but database operations fail due to missing RLS (Row Level Security) policies in Supabase.

## Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **Form Wizard UI**
   - 3-step wizard navigation works correctly
   - Form validation functions properly
   - Character counters update in real-time
   - Required field validation works
   - Next/Previous buttons enable/disable correctly

2. **Form Data Collection**
   - Step 1 (Basic Info): All fields capture data correctly
   - Step 2 (Visuals): Theme color selection and image URL work
   - Step 3 (Settings): Privacy and player limit settings function

3. **User Experience**
   - Progressive validation (errors only after interaction)
   - Clear visual feedback for selected options
   - Loading states display properly
   - Toast notifications appear for errors

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **RLS Policy Error (403 Forbidden)**
   - Error Code: `42501`
   - Message: "permission denied for schema public"
   - Occurs when trying to insert into the `games` table
   - Root Cause: RLS policies not applied to Supabase database

2. **RLS Bypass Misconception**
   - The `rls_bypass_enabled` flag in localStorage only shows a UI banner
   - It doesn't actually bypass RLS at the database level
   - This is a development helper, not a true bypass mechanism

## Solution Required

### Option 1: Apply RLS Policies (Recommended)
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `/supabase/policies/apply-basic-rls.sql`
4. Verify policies are applied

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable RLS (Development Only)
**⚠️ WARNING: Never do this in production!**
```sql
-- Disable RLS temporarily for testing
ALTER TABLE games DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE game_players DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Option 3: Use Service Role Key (Development Only)
Modify the Supabase client to use the service role key which bypasses RLS:
- Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `.env.local`
- Create a server-side API route for game creation
- Use service role client for database operations

## Technical Details

### Request Flow
1. User fills form → `createGame()` in `/src/lib/api/games.ts`
2. Supabase client uses anon key → Makes INSERT request
3. Supabase checks RLS policies → No policies found
4. Request denied with 403 error

### Files Involved
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/games/create/page.tsx` - Create game wizard
- `/src/lib/api/games.ts` - Game API functions
- `/src/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `/src/lib/utils/rls-helper.ts` - RLS error handling utilities

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix**: Apply the basic RLS policies using the provided SQL file
2. **Long-term**: Implement proper RLS policies for all tables
3. **Development**: Consider creating a development-only API route that uses service role key
4. **Testing**: Add integration tests that verify RLS policies work correctly

## Test Data Used
- Game Name: "The Lost Mines of Phandelver"
- Description: "A classic D&D 5e adventure perfect for new players..."
- Campaign: "Starter Set Campaign"
- System: D&D 5th Edition
- Privacy: Private
- Max Players: 4

## Next Steps
1. Apply RLS policies to Supabase database
2. Retry game creation flow
3. Verify successful creation and redirect to game page
4. Test with different privacy settings
5. Test player invitation flow

## Additional Notes
- The UI/UX is well-designed and user-friendly
- Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- The toast notification system helps users understand issues
- Consider adding a development mode that uses a local database
